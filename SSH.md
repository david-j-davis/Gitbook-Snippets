##How to ssh into your server for github deployment
---

####ssh into the server with terminal commands:

    ssh root@example.com
    cd / (brings you to the root)
    cd var/www/live
    ls (displays contents in that folder)

####I then did terminal commands (disregard this):

    git init
    touch .gitignore
    touch README.md
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your/repo.git

####I then opened up another terminal window and ssh'd into the server again:

    cd .ssh
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (to display ssh key)

####Copy and paste the ssh key into my github account under settings > SSH & GPG Keys

####Now push and pull away:

    git push -u origin master
    git pull -u origin master
    
    exit (to close ssh connection)
